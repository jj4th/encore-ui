<p>
  To display and hide content, you can use rxCollapse. It can be set as
  either expanded or collapsed on page load. A double chevron is used as
  a toggle to show/hide the inner contents, while keeping the header and
  border visible.

<h3>See More/See Less</h3>
<p>
  In areas where metadata needs to be available but space is limited, you
  can use a "See More"/"See Less" link to expand and show additional
  metadata. The most relevant lines of metadata should display on page
  load with less relevant lines of metadata hidden behind "See More".
</p>
<ul class="list">
  <li>
    This pattern is not very responsive friendly. The column wrap will
    place your data out of context, making it difficult to read.
  </li>
  <li>
    So you can design responsively, data hidden by rxCollapse should only
    be used at the end of the page's final column.
  </li>
</ul>
