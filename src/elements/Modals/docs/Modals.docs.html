<p>
  The Modal component provides a hook to open and perform operations on a modal window.
</p>

<h3><rx-permalink>Regular Modals</rx-permalink></h3>
<p>
  Use modals whenever a user needs to take an action that needs their
  attention, or you want to interrupt a user's current task to redirect a
  user's full attention to something more important.
</p>
<rx-example name="modals.regular"></rx-example>

<h3><rx-permalink>Multi-View Modals</rx-permalink></h3>
<p>
  A multi-view modal breaks apart complex interactions so modal content
  isn't too long. Multi-view modals also work well when the user must
  complete multiple sequential steps.
</p>
<p>
  It works for cases when removing or deleting something needing a
  confirmation click, such as "Are You Sure you want to Remove this?"

<h4>Design Patterns within Encore</h4>
<ul class="list">
  <li>
    When should you use modals instead of a new page?
    <ul class="list">
      <li>
        According to Bootstrap, "Modals are streamlined, but flexible,
        dialog prompts with the minimum required functionality and smart
        defaults."
      </li>
      <li>
        In Encore, you should use modals for confirmation messaging. For
        notifications you will use rxNotification, which is the static
        subdirective of rxNotify. See the example below which uses
        <code>type="error"</code>. <code>type="error"</code> can be
        replaced with the appropriate message response style.
      </li>
      <li>
        You also can use modals to edit content in lieu of having an edit
        view. This design pattern is not ideal. An Edit View will need to
        be considered as a pattern in future iterations.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    Using the rxModalForm subdirective will automatically provide you with
    a title, subtitle, submit and cancel text. You can use rxForm elements
    within rxModalForm.
  </li>

    For real world examples, take a look at the
    <a href="https://github.com/rackerlabs/encore-cloud-ui/blob/master/app/views/servers/templates/server-actions.html">
      ng-template blocks triggered from server action links
    </a>
    under Encore Cloud.
  </li>
  <li>
    If you need to deviate from the title / footer pattern at all, you'll
    need to take a look at the
    <a href="https://github.com/rackerlabs/encore-ui/blob/master/src/elements/Modals/templates/rxModalActionForm.html">
      rxModalForm directive template markup
    </a>
    and build upon that.
  </li>
</ul>
<rx-example name="modals.delete"></rx-example>

<div class="example-case do">
  <h4>DO</h4>
  <ul class="list">
    <li>Do use modals to perform actions requiring the users full attention.</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div class="example-case avoid">
  <h4>DON'T</h4>
  <ul class="list">
    <li>
      Don't display a modal without an action button, or a way to close the modal by closing the modal via X or pressing the Cancel button.
    </li>
    <li>Don't use modals as pop-ups, having them appear without the user clicking something</li>
    <li>Don't use modals referring to information on the originating page</li>
    <li>Don't use a modal to display a set of info or metadata without any direct actions</li>
  </ul>
</div>
